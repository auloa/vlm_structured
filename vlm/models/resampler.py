"""Cross-attention resampler that maps visual features into the LLM space.

This replaces the simple MLP projector. Instead of mapping each Donut visual
token 1:1 into the LLM embedding space, a small set of learned query tokens
attend to the visual features and produce a compressed, information-dense
set of visual tokens for the LM.

Why this might help: with the MLP projector, the LM sees ~1200 visual
positions and tends to under-attend to them (they're out-of-distribution
relative to its text-token training). A resampler hands the LM a smaller
(~64), denser visual region that's easier to attend to, and the learned
queries are gradient-pressured to extract task-relevant content.

This is the "Perceiver Resampler" pattern (Flamingo, 2022) without the
self-attention layer between queries.
